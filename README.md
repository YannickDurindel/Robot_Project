# Robot_Project
Repository for all the code I have been using in C for coding my arduino on a project at school

At ICAM, site de Toulouse, an engineering school in France, we have a project in the field of robotic in first year. 
This repo is made to share my codes, the last evaluation is passed so, there is no more competition, I can share working versions now...
The goal of the robot is this : You have a curved white line on a black carpet, et is 2 meters long, on one edge, the is a cup filled with 10 metal marbles, and on the other edge, another cup which is empty. The very goal is to take 9 of the ten marbles into the empty cup.
We work on a team of 5 people, my role is to code and manage the arduino wires and motors, while others do the physical infrastructure. I have done a bit of modeling and creating pieces, but not much.
So the robot has a arm that catches the cup, put 10 marbles in a system that keeps the balls, realese the cup, turn around and follow the line to the other edge. There is the cup, and a system put 9 marbles out of 10 in the empty cup.

Turns out we did a battle with the whole class, and out of the 9 robots, ours went first, we were the fastest to do the work !
